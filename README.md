# Diversity-in-Hackathons
Despite their widespread adoption, hackathons have been criticized for their lack of diversity. This led to various initiatives to expand participation in terms of gender, geography, etc. This project is aimed to - a) study the extent of initiatives taken to diversify, b) their impact on the hackathon landscape and the wider open-source ecosystem.
