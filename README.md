Despite their widespread adoption, hackathons have been criticized for their lack of diversity. This led to various initiatives to expand participation in terms of gender, geography, etc. This project is aimed to - a) study the extent of initiatives taken to diversify, b) their impact on the hackathon landscape and the wider open-source ecosystem.

**Abstract of paper:** Hackathons play a crucial role in fostering innovation and collaboration within the tech community, yet gender diversity remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the impact of gender diversity initiatives and learning-focused themes on female participation in hackathons. By analyzing data from Devpost, it was found that hackathons with explicit gender diversity initiatives exhibit significantly higher women participation rates compared to those without such initiatives. Furthermore, hackathons promoting learning themes also attract more women participants. Descriptive statistics revealed notable gender disparities in skillsets and participation trends, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. The results highlight the importance of implementing strategies such as mentorship programs and inclusive event designs to enhance gender diversity. Despite these positive findings, the study highlights the limitations of using self-reported data, and the accuracy of gender inference tools, that can introduce some biases. The study also makes recommendations to hackathon organisers using the empirical analysis conducted, and includes suggestions for future researchers hoping to take this research ahead.
